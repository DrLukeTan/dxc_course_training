"Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, will hand over his position to Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on May 15, reflecting the carefully planned leadership transition from the third to the fourth generation of Singapore's leaders. The departure of Lee Hsien Loong will signify the end of his almost 20-year tenure, and the transfer of leadership is seen as an accelerated timeline, potentially suggesting an earlier-than-anticipated general election. Wong and his team will have to work to win over voters and show their competency in the cut-throat world of politics, with the impending election being held against a backdrop of concerns about complacency and unpopular policies."
