"PM Lee remains in service as Senior Minister, no major Cabinet reshuffle\n\nPrime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, will continue to serve in the Cabinet as Senior Minister after stepping down from his position, said Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lawrence Wong, while explaining there will be no major Cabinet reshuffle before the upcoming General Election.\n\nAccording to Mr Wong, his priority now is to ensure continuity and form the best Cabinet team for Singapore before he is sworn in as the 4th Prime Minister of Singapore on May 15.\n\nTherefore, he will announce his new Cabinet line-up in a media session a few days before the swearing-in ceremony at Istana.\n\nMr Wong, 51, who is also Finance Minister, said this in his first media briefing since the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) announced on April 15 that he would officially take over the leadership reins from Mr Lee next month.\n\nHe told reporters that he anticipated the current Cabinet ministers would remain in their portfolios with some minor realignments. Those who will continue their roles include Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security, Mr Teo Chee Hean.\n\n\"Our system works based on continuity and progressive change. It has never happened that when there is a leadership transition, all the old ministers resign at the same time,\" he said.\n\n\"Instead, they continue to contribute in different ways and give room for the younger ones to step forward.\n\n\"So I will take the same approach when I take over.\"\n\nFurthermore, with some ministers having recently been appointed, Mr Wong said they will continue to serve in their respective portfolios.\n\nHowever, Mr Wong shared that he is in the process of consulting with current Cabinet ministers regarding their appointments and will take their considerations into account.\n\nHe is considering promoting some Members of Parliament (MPs) and bringing in some fresh faces to strengthen the 4th generation leadership team.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Wong also expressed his happiness that Mr Lee has agreed to continue to serve and hold the position of Senior Minister, acknowledging his contribution to Singapore during his 20 years of leading the country.\n\n\"During this time, our economy has grown rapidly, and Singaporeans have enjoyed consistent improvements in their income and quality of life.\n\n\"We have weathered many crises and emerged stronger each time. Our international standing has improved significantly, and the Singapore brand is admired and respected all over the world,\" he said.\n\nMr Wong emphasized that a larger Cabinet reshuffle may only occur after the upcoming General Election, which must be held by November 2025.\n\nHe added that he has already started efforts to look for new candidates, especially those who show potential to hold political positions.\n\n\"So depending on the outcome of the General Election, there will be opportunities to renew and strengthen the team with new members,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about his considerations in forming the new Cabinet, Mr Wong replied that his main priority is to form the best team for Singapore, with a focus on change and continuity.\n\n\"We have to build on what we have today. We have to affirm and strengthen what has worked well for Singapore,\" he said.\n\n\"I also want change because we have to examine and refresh our current approaches and be ready to chart new directions to adapt more effectively to a rapidly changing environment.\n\n\"I want to, when the time comes, achieve a balance between experienced ministers and new team members who can add new perspectives to our discussions.\""
