"Singapore's next Prime Minister, Lawrence Wong, announced that a new Cabinet will be sworn in on May 15. Meanwhile, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will remain Senior Minister after stepping down as leader of the government. However, any major changes to the team will come after the General Election, which must be held by November 2025. Wong is in the midst of looking for new candidates, especially those with potential to hold political office, and hopes to present a new slate of candidates when the election is called. Election preparation is ongoing and a full agenda remains for the current term of the government. There was no indication of when the General Election would be held."
