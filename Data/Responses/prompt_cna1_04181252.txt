"The article discusses the upcoming transition of power from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to his deputy, Lawrence Wong, and the implications it has for the upcoming general election. The handover is happening earlier than expected and suggests that a general election could be called sooner rather than later. Wong and the 4G team will have to work on winning the hearts and minds of voters and presenting their vision for Singapore's future. The article also mentions concerns about complacency, unpopular policies, and recent controversies involving senior party leaders on both sides. The first window for the general election is September 2024, but it remains to be seen when it will actually take place. There is also a desire for more political competition and diversity in the electorate. The article does not mention any specific dates besides the upcoming handover on May 15."
