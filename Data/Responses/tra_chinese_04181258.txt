"Cordlife Group Limited raised approximately SGD 8.19 million by issuing new stocks at a price of SGD 0.16 per share, with the aim of rebranding and increasing their emergency cash reserves following a drop in both their image and stock price due to a cord blood mishap. The new stocks account for approximately 20% of the company's existing issued shares, with approximately 16.6% of the enlarged share capital after the subscription completed. The new stocks were purchased by Charming Global Enterprises and individual investor Ng Junwei Darren, who bought 44.54 million and 6.66 million shares, respectively. After deducting the financing costs, Cordlife Group Limited raised net proceeds of SGD 8.04 million, which will be used as operating capital and to rebuild their brand. The total number of cord blood units impacted by the temperature mismanagement issue amounts to approximately 7,500, including the latest 5,300 units. Cordlife plans to complete testing and screening on the remaining 14,000 units in approximately one year. The impact of the cord blood mishap is predicted to reduce Cordlife Group Limited's revenue by approximately SGD 9.2 million and is expected to negatively affect the company's financial performance this fiscal year. As a result, the company's annual general meeting will be postponed by two weeks. Following the announcement, Cordlife Group Limited's stock prices fell by nearly 10% within the first hour of trading. The company's shares have been trading quietly this week and closed at SGD 0.15 on Wednesday, up 1.35%."
