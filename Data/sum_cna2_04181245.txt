"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will remain in Cabinet as Senior Minister following his handover of leadership, according to Singapore's next Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. The new Cabinet will be sworn in on May 15, with most existing ministers expected to remain in their roles for now, but bigger changes to the team will be made after the General Election, due to be held by November 2025. Wong said his priority was to form the best possible team to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, with a balance between experienced ministers and new members who can add fresh perspectives."
